# project-4-group-2
Final bootcamp project analyzing liver cirrhosis data and using machine learning to predict cirrhosis stages.
Members: Amy Dohlin, Anna Bitzer, Tianyue Li, Christine Jauregui

Topic: Liver Cirrhosis Prediction
Dataset: Liver Cirrhosis Stage Classification 🩺 (kaggle.com) (25,000+ rows)
Goal: Create, train and deploy a neural network machine learning model that can predict liver cirrhosis stage based on patient lab result data.

Outline of Duties:
Data Cleaning/ETL (Jupyter Notebook): Amy
Check for null values
Check data types
Drop any unnecessary columns
Export a clean csv 
Preliminary Visualizations (MatplotLib, Jupyter Notebook): Tianyue
Overview/summary statistics of the dataset
Include in same jupyter notebook as data cleaning
Create Training Model (Google Colab, incorporate SQL/Spark): Amy, Christine
Look at models like random forest, neural networks, etm.
Categorical vs discrete variable cleaning (one-hot encoding)
Drop irrelevant columns, if any
Training vs test data
Choose various neural network parameters
Optimize Model: Tianyue, Anna
Use PCA to eliminate less-impactful factors to make our model concise and strong
Analyze the model accuracy using confusion matrix and classification report
Use tensorflow to optimize the activation function
Document changes along the way, and effect on accuracy
Resulting Visualizations (Tableau?): Group
Highlight the findings of our neural network
