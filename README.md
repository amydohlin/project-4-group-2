# project-4-group-2
Final bootcamp project analyzing liver cirrhosis data and using machine learning to predict cirrhosis stages.  
Members: Amy Dohlin, Anna Bitzer, Tianyue Li, Christine Jauregui

Topic: Liver Cirrhosis Prediction  
Dataset: Liver Cirrhosis Stage Classification ðŸ©º (kaggle.com) (25,000+ rows)  
Goal: Create, train and deploy a neural network machine learning model that can predict liver cirrhosis stage based on patient lab result data. 

PHASE I: Data Cleaning
Amy used VSCode
Data Cleaning/ETL (Jupyter Notebook): Amy  
Check for null values  
Check data types  
Drop any unnecessary columns  
Export a clean csv   
Preliminary Visualizations (MatplotLib, Jupyter Notebook): Tianyue  
Overview/summary statistics of the dataset  
Include in same jupyter notebook as data cleaning  
Create Training Model (Google Colab, incorporate SQL/Spark): Amy, Christine  
Look at models like random forest, neural networks, etm.  
Categorical vs discrete variable cleaning (one-hot encoding)  
Drop irrelevant columns, if any  
Training vs test data  
Choose various neural network parameters  
Optimize Model: Tianyue, Anna  
Use PCA to eliminate less-impactful factors to make our model concise and strong  
Analyze the model accuracy using confusion matrix and classification report  
Use tensorflow to optimize the activation function  
Document changes along the way, and effect on accuracy  
Resulting Visualizations (Tableau?): Group  
Highlight the findings of our neural network

Cirrhosis results from prolonged liver damage, leading to extensive scarring, often due to conditions like hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption. The data provided is sourced from a Mayo Clinic study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver carried out from 1974 to 1984.
